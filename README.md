# PushPill

PushPill encourages the safe and timely consumption of medication using a reminder system for patients and their doctors or guardians. Doctors can add patients and create medication schedules for them by uploading images of medicine and important information. Based on their schedules, patients are notified about their medication at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and if they fail to respond within 30 minutes, their doctor is automatically alerted. Doctors can resend an urgent message to their patients from the app, preventing the risks created by self-regulation. The streamlined coordination between doctors and patients is what makes PushPill a powerful app.
